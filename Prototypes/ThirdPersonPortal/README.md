# Third Person Portal
An exploration in making a third person version of Portal that ended up with some interesting shader effects.
This was made for school as an Unreal solo project.

## Effect portals
* Looking through a portal adds an effect to that area of the screen.
* Walking through a portal applies the same effect to everything.
* Walking through the same portal again removes the effect.

## Transportation portals
* Can be looked through, walked through and shot through.
